          <p>I track my own creativity and watch it gather and manifest itself in different forms throughout my life. From legos, fine art sculpting to design, development and community engagement.</p>
          <p>I deeply care about the communities around me and positively impacting others everyday. Those communities have helped me refine my craft, learn empathy, and I am grateful for all the perspectives others have shown me.</p>
          <p>My resume is available upon request.</p>
